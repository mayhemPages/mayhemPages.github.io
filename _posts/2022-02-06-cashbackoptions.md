once you've received your card, these are some purchases to take advantage of the cashback:  

> if you haven't joined yet, check the [cdclink](https://mayhempages.com/cdclink/) and use the [apgys4dy9u](https://crypto.com/app/apgys4dy9u) referral to join crypto.com and stake your card.

- phone / internet / TV bill
- streaming services (Netflix would be fully reimbursed, but you can also use it for other streaming services and get the %3 back)
- groceries
- bars / restaurants (pick up the bill if out with friends, and have money sent after)
- gas (remember to pay inside for gas - some stations have this code at the pump which is different and might not trigger the cashback)
- amazon / shopping (including subscribing to Prime - if you managed to get the icy card that's great and would be totally reimbursed, if not, that 3% would still be good)
- paying for daycare / school / kindergarten / tuition payments - these are usually big expenses and using a debit card wouldn't trigger any admin chargers
- electronics - games, consoles, phones ... all these bigger expenses would trigger a nice cashback
- if you rent and things break down, offer to replace them (and take it off rent), this way you'd make "double" the cashback - works as a landlord as well 
- paying rent might also be an option (depending on your setup, as "financial payments", like mortgages, or taxes, usually won't get cashback)
- gift cards - one way here is to buy giftcards with your crypto.com card ... but there are also giftcards to buy from crypto.com (in the app, open the "pay" option and you have "Gift Cards") and these offer cashback rewards between 2%-10%.
- flights, travel, hotels, Uber/Lyft or car rentals - especially if traveling for work
- very large payments (like a car) - there is a 25k limit per month, but you can wait till the end of the month, split it into 2payments, and sort it
- try to find a trusted person to cover your utility bills and you cover their groceries or large expenses (basically free CRO)
