[crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) - 10m users, 250+ cryptocurrencies ... has 3 different ways of accesing and trading crypto:

- crypto.com App 
  - you install on your phone, access from anywhere, easy to buy crypto, set up earn programs (12% APR, even 14% if staking for higher cards), access to your awesome debit card, and run daily missions 
  - while the advertised fees are small, usually the overall cost of the coins is higher than you would get on the exchange (1-2% would go to "the spread")

- crypto.com exchange 
  - access to more advanced exchange features, trade crypto with "low fees and deep liquidity", spot/features/syndicate access
  - the easiest way to get crypto which you can trade, is to go through the app, exchange for a stablecoin, and then move that coin to the exchange, where you'll have access to more/better tools

- crypto.com defi app - "your keys your crypto", 100+ coins, access to earn/swap programs
 
If you decide to join crypto.com, use [apgys4dy9u](https://crypto.com/app/apgys4dy9u) as a refferal code and you'll get 25$.

> to get started, use the [apgys4dy9u](https://crypto.com/app/apgys4dy9u) link (with the refferal), signup proving your full name, copy of government-issues ID, and take a selfie (pass the KYC). Once you complete this, stake for at least a [Ruby Steel VisaCard](https://crypto.com/cards) and you'll get the bonus unlocked, plus access to the cards benefits (Ruby has 2% cashback, but cards like JadeGreen would get 3% and quite a few perks - like Netflix and Spotify for free, and access to Airport LoungeKey)
