If you decide to join the crypto.com app, use [apgys4dy9u](https://crypto.com/app/apgys4dy9u) as a refferal code and you'll get 25$.

To get started, use the [apgys4dy9u](https://crypto.com/app/apgys4dy9u) link (with the refferal):

- signup proving your full name, copy of government-issues ID, and take a selfie (pass the KYC). 
- Once you complete this, stake for at least a [Ruby Steel VisaCard](https://crypto.com/cards) and you'll get the bonus unlocked, plus access to the cards benefits (Ruby has 2% cashback, but cards like JadeGreen would get 3% and quite a few perks - like Netflix and Spotify for free, and access to Airport LoungeKey)

I staked the Jade Green (which after much research is obviously better than the Royal Indigo :)):

Which would pay out the Netflix and Spotify subscriptions, as well as get a nice 3% cashback - all this, while having the 10% APR for the staked CRO.

Without putting in the cashback, in one year you would get:
- USD $13.99 for Netflix x12 -> $167.88
- USD $12.99 for Spotify x12 -> $155.88
- USD $4000 x 10%APR -> $400
that is about $723 which means just above **18% APR** for your initial investment of $4000.

and all this without considering the cashback - check this for more ideas on maximizing your cashback.
