Started my crypto journey a long time ago, with building mining rigs, moved to validator nodes, cashed out a few times, and came back for defi/web3/nfts but also crypto.com and FTX apps/exchanges. 

I'll use this blog as a repository of tips'n'tricks, lessons learned, log the hiccups I've encountered, and things I've picked up along the way. Plan is to use it as my "own log", but maybe it'll help you as well!
